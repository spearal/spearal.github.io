<p>Spearal is a new, <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">open-source</a>, serialization protocol that aims to provide a drop-in replacement of JSON for (at least) HTML and native mobile applications. The primary goal of Spearal is to offer a serialization protocol that simply works, whatever is the complexity of data structures exchanged between endpoints: several JSON limitations are poisoning developers with problems that wouldn't happen with a good and versatile serialization format.</p>

<p>Beyond this primary goal, Spearal is also offering advanced features that doesn't exist in standard JSON, such as partial object serialization, built-in support for JPA uninitialized associations, divergent models reconciliation, object properties filtering, etc. While it is still in an early development stage, Spearal is already usable for HTML applications connected to a Java backend. Android support is mostly ready and iOS will follow soon.</p>
