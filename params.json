{"name":"Spearal","tagline":"Spearal Serialization Protocol","body":"### Welcome to the Spearal Serialization Protocol.\r\n\r\nSpearal is a new, [open-source](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), serialization protocol that aims to provide a drop-in replacement of JSON for (at least) HTML and native mobile applications. The primary goal of Spearal is to offer a serialization protocol that simply works, whatever is the complexity of data structures exchanged between endpoints: several JSON limitations are poisoning developers with problems that wouldn't happen with a good and versatile serialization format.\r\n\r\nBeyond this primary goal, Spearal is also offering advanced features that doesn't exist in standard JSON, such as partial object serialization, built-in support for JPA uninitialized associations, divergent models reconciliation, object properties filtering, etc. While it is still in an early development stage, Spearal is already usable for HTML applications connected to a Java backend. Android support is mostly ready and iOS will follow soon.\r\n\r\nGo to the [Spearal project page](https://github.com/spearal).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
